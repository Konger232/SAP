                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <p>My name is Ping. Born in Hong Kong, I spent my high school years in the United States, 
                an experience shaped my creative perspective.  Today, I'm based in Bangkok, Thailand, 
                where I continue to explore design, technology, and culture across borders.</p>

                <p>I am currently working toward a Digital Media Design graduate degree at Harvard Extension 
                School. My academic focus reflects my long-standing interest in the intersection of 
                design, user experience, and technology.</p>

                <p>My background includes experience in web development and interface design, with hands-on 
                work in user interface design and prototyping using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. I also 
                have experience with Python and have been exposed to the Django framework, which has 
                helped me understand how design and development connect on both the front end and back 
                end.</p>

                <p>I decided to take this course because I want to dive deeper into React.js and learn how 
                to build modern, responsive, and interactive web applications. After spending time away 
                from my role as a user interface designer and business analyst, this course is a perfect 
                opportunity to refresh my development skills and explore how to create user interfaces 
                that adapt smoothly across devices.</p>

                <p>Outside of my academic and professional work, I stay creatively and socially engaged by 
                volunteering with my local scout troop and helping with theatre staging at my children's 
                school, where I enjoy supporting creative projects behind the scenes. I also love to 
                travel and keep a sketchbook with me to capture observations, environments, and everyday 
                moments from my surroundings.</p>

                <p>One place that continues to inspire me is the beach, which represents calm, clarity, and 
                balance in my life. It's where I feel most grounded and creatively refreshed.</p>

                </div>

                <p>When I'm in Bangkok, one of my favorite places to eat is 
                <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/TLWk4KUbGzUbVdCh8" target="_blank">Rongros</a>, a restaurant located 
                across from Wat Arun (the Sunset Temple) in downtown Bangkok, which I often recommend for both its 
                atmosphere and its food.</p>
